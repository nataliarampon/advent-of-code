# Musings

So, it seems I should start using structs at least, since Go doesn't really have classes. These whole array of arrays, and maps of array of arrays is getting messy and confusing without a structured data approach.

Part 2 of this problem seems to have even more complexity, so I may try usings structs on Part 2. Which also would lead me to refactor Part 1. But I don't really have any unit tests to guarantee no regression errors... I should probably look into how a test suite might look like in Go next.
